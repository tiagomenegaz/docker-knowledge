# Docker-knowledge

This is my miscellaneous collection of resources about docker. I decided to help others and myself to create this repository to organize everything I see about this amazing technology. Please feel free to contact me about this project.

### Docker Basic Commands

```
docker run <image> # Run a command in a new container
docker start <name|id> # Start one or more stopped containers
docker stop <name|id> # Stop one or more running containers
docker ps <name|id> # List containers
docker rm # Remove one or more containers
docker rmi # Remove one or more images
```
